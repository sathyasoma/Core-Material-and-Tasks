Method(s):
`
  c language --> function
  
  java language --> method
  
 
->method is the location where we are writing the logic to perform some operations based on the requirement.

syntax:
``

   [accessmodifier] <returntype>  <methodname>([parameters if any])//head
   {
     //logic//body 
   }
   
 eg:
 
   public static void main(String[] args)//method heading
   {
      //logic//method body
   }

eg:
define one method with name as disply which displays "HelloJava"

             void display()
			 {
			    System.out.println("HelloJava");
			 }

eg:

define one method which retuns person's age?

             int getAge()
			 {
			    return 90;
			 }

note:
``
return value and return type must be compatible(same)


eg:

define one method which returns name of the employee?

         String getEmployeeName()
		 {
		    return "Shree";
		 }

eg:

define one method which retuns salary of the employee?

          double getEmployeeSalary()
		  {
		     return 6789.00;
		  }

eg:

define one method which retuns grade of the student?


    char getStudentGrade()
	{
	  return 'A';
	}
	
eg:

define one method which retuns whether student is active or not?

 true
 false
 

boolean isStudentActive()
{
   return true;
}


eg:

define one method which takes two integer values and 
returns their sum?

   int getSum(int x, int y)
   {
      return x+y;
   }

eg:

define one method which takes their firstname and lastname
and gives their full name?



note:
`
while we are defining methods, we are not allowed to gives
spaces in between.

eg:

String getFullName(String firstname,String lastname)
{
  return firstname+lastname;
}


eg:

define one method which takes student name and student id
and displays their information?


void getStudentDetails(String studentname,int studentid)
{
 System.out.println(studentname);
 System.out.println(studentid);
}


eg:
`
define one method which takes employee salary and displays
their annual salary?


void getEmployeeAnnualSalary(double employeesalary)
{
 System.out.println(employeesalary*12);
}
