What Are Props in React:
------------------------
*Props simply stands for properties. 
*They are what make components reusable. 
*Because they perform an essential function â€“ they pass data from one component to another.  
*Props act as a channel for component communication. 
*Props are passed from parent to child and help your child access properties that made it into the parent's tree.

=>We use props in both functional and class-based components.
=>We pass props from the top to bottom. 
    *We can also refer to it as ancestor to descendant, or parent to child.
=>Props are read-only. 
    *This means that once a component receives a bunch of props, we cannot change it, but we can only use and consume it and cannot modify the properties passed down to the component. 
	*If we want to modify that, we'll have to introduce what we call state in React.

App.jsx:
----------

import React from "react";
 
function MyProducts(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.name}</h1>
      <p>{props.description}</p>
      <p>{props.price}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
 
export default MyProducts;

MyProduct.jsx:
--------------

import "./App.css";
import MyProducts from "./MyProducts";
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <MyProducts
        name="temitope"
        description="the product has fantastic features"
        price={1000}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
 
export default App;


How to Use Props With Destructuring
====================================:
*Destructuring is a JavaScript feature that allows you to extract sections 
     of data from an array or object.
